# Models

Each subfolder contains a placeholder data pipeline for a model family. Pipelines share the same feature/target schema so experiments stay aligned.

- `bpnn/`: Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNNs)
- `knn/`: Known Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- `rfr/`: Random Forest Regression (RFR)
- `linear_regression/`: Linear Regression
